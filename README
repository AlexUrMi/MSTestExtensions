An extendible implementation of the Assert class in MSTest. Allows for extending the Assert methods with the default MSTest methods as a default. Also includes a Throws() method for asserting exceptions.

To get started, add the MsTestExtensions.dll lib to your project.

Add a using/import MsTestExtensions entry within your class.

Inherit from BaseTest with the Test Class you are using and you should see Assert.Throws(...) in intellisense.

If you would rather not inherit from BaseTest you can use the syntax:

ExceptionAssert.Throws(...)

Lastly if the above options do not suite, you can add the following within your test class:

public static readonly IAssertion Assert = new Assertion();

NB IAssertion is the interface to use for adding your own custom extensions.
