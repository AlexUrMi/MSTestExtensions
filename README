An extendible implementation of the Assert class in MSTest. Allows for extending the Assert methods with the default MSTest methods as a default. Also includes a Throws() method for asserting exceptions.

* 1. To get started, add the MsTestExtensions.dll lib to your project (I'm assuming you may have downloaded the package from Nuget to do this: package name = MsTestExtensions).

* 2. Add a using/import MsTestExtensions entry within your class.

* 3.

** 3a. Inherit from BaseTest with the Test Class you are using and you should see Assert.Throws(...) in intellisense.

** 3b. If you would rather not inherit from BaseTest you can use the syntax: ExceptionAssert.Throws(...)

** 3c. Lastly if the above options do not suite, you can add the following within your test class: public static readonly IAssertion Assert = new Assertion();

NB IAssertion is the interface to use for adding your own custom extensions.
